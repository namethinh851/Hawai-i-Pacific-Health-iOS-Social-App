# Hawai-i-Pacific-Health-iOS-Social-App
This is a mock-up (using Sketch) to an iOS application for Hawai'i Pacific Health to enhance sociability within hospitals

The idea behind this application is to solve the shortage of public events in Hawai'i regarding to medical preventions. Because of the shortage, the state has experience a big increase in mental illnesses, according to an article found in: "http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/22758669/statewide-study-identifies-hawaiis-top-health-concerns". 

Patients / Non-patients who use this application can find supporting groups and events within the hospitals (and outside of the hospital) much easier. 

The name of this app is called Ho'ōla, which means healing in Hawai'i. Below is an explanation of how the app works.

The design of ho'ōla is similar to the smartphone application hāpai by HPH. The similarity gives the users a sense of unity in the HPH system.

What presented above is what I would like to do to not only make Hawai’i healthier, but also to increase the impact that HPH has on the islands. 

If HPH chooses to implement this kind of technology into the hospital, it would be the first in the nation to do so. Moreover, the hospital as a whole will experience an rapid increase in patient’s satisfaction and healing time. According to the Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine journal, in an article called: “The role of social relationship in HIV healing and its implications in HIV cure in China,” it stated that social relationships played a major role in helping HIV patients in China. If this is the case, imagine the impact of social relationships would have on other patients.
